How to play the game: 
In the offense mode, the player will get 20 balls in the beginning. The player can only move along four directions along using the keyboard and shoot the ball by clicking the mouse to wherever he wants to shoot. When the defenders show up on the screen, the player has to either avoid it by moving left and right or use the ball to knock over the defender. The baskets come towards the player at the same time as the defenders. The shot will be blocked if the defender is on the path of your shot to the basket. The total number of the balls decreases whenever the player uses a ball. Each time the player makes a basket, he gains three new balls, whereas each time the player touches a defender without shooting the ball, he loses 5 points. The speed of the defenders will increase as the game goes forward and there will be new character & new moving patterns appear. Player wins when he gets 100 balls.

In the Practice mode, the player will try to avoid the balls as long as possible by using keyboard to move around. The player loses whenever he/she hits the ball.  


Keys/Mouse input: Left--A Right--D Up--W Down--S, Click the mouse to shoot, ESC to go back to starting menu.

Cheat Keys: slow down the game--keyboard LEFT, back to default--keyboard RIGHT
	    add more points to each ball the player makes--keyboard UP, back to default--keyboard DOWN

Known bugs: The player can possibly move out of the screen by using the keyboard.

Extra features: More characters could potentially be brount in. And there could be a boss mode. Right now the hardest part of the offense mode is that the defenders will shake left and right randomly while moving down towards the player in a very high speed. 

Impressions/Suggestions: Still have a lot of potential to do refactorying. And the game could definitely add more features or rules.
